# Palate

This is a restaurant searching app developed in Kotlin using Android Studio for Android.

# Backend

I have used the Yelp REST API for this application, using which I extract the relevant data to display to the users.
I use the cuisine along with city name to send a request to the Yelp API.

# Frontend

I have utilized a recycler view with a constraint layout to display the relevant information such as name, price, address and ratings from different restraunts over the city serving similiar cuisines.
To get a request from the user, I have used a Linear Layout with edit texts and buttons where input can be received.
